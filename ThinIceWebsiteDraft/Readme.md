====================

**Sub-pages** have the content for each "page" that will be shown to the user
- *home* contains the home page and is the default page loaded
- *news* contains the news page and a folder that contains each news item where the name of each item is the date of publication (A template will be created which describes how to create a news item)
- *team* contains the team page
- *pub-and-pre* contains the publications & presentation page

**Images** and other static content is stored in the images folder/directory

**Scripts** are stored in the scripts folder/directory. Scripts that correspond to specific sub-pages will be stored in a folder with the exact name as the sub-page
